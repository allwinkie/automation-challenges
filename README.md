automation-challenges
=====================

Coding challenges for the Vocalocity Automation Team

Instructions
============

* Fork this repository to your github account
 * Complete each challenge in whatever order you want, at whatever pace you want. There is no time limit.
 * Be as complex or as simple as you want, and use whatever language you want. Sometimes we are looking for complex code solutions, other times we are not. The language used is not really a point of concern.
 * Documented solutions are better than undocumented ones
 * Solutions with good, useful tests are better than solutions without good, useful tests
 * Above all, your solutions must run. If it is okay for a solution to not run, or to be untested, the README in that project will note such.
* When you are done with the challenges, send a Pull Request, and we'll get back to you
